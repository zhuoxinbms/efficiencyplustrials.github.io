*** Group Advisor Role
 Group Advisor Responsibilities (Minimal Time Commitment)
  - Regulatory Guidance: Provide regulatory perspectives relevant to operations and promote applications of statistics and “design of operations” when appropriate.
  - Ad Hoc Consultations: Participate in brief (e.g., quarterly) meeting(s) to share insights on regulatory trends or answer targeted questions from the group.
  - Review Major Outputs: Review and comment on major deliverables (e.g., position statements, white papers) from a regulatory standpointlimited to essential feedback.
  - Networking Connector: Recommend, if possible, other experts or resources for deep dives beyond the advisor’s scope or time constraints.
  - Advisor role ideally requires no more than 1 hour/month on average.
  - Participation in group meetings is optional, mainly for significant milestones.
** Meeting Frequency
 - Every two weeks to build a strong foundation of contents
 - Slow down to once a month in 6-12 months
 - Slow further once sub workstreams gain momentum
