  that you would like to contribute to.
  
** Site selection and performance modeling using data-driven approaches

  + Bohdana Ratitch: Which predictive analytics and ML approaches are the most suitable and effective 
    for data-driven site performance modeling?
  + Palani Ravindran:
     - How do data privacy or access limitations impact the effectiveness of above?
     - How to use RWD or external data sources to identify additional sites
  + Bochao Jia: may need to evaluate site performance in different perspectives: operational performance (i.e focus on key risk indication and QTLs) and data quality (i.e     identify odds data pattern and anomalies).
  + Zhuoxin Yu: What public available data or commercially avaialble database could be leveraged to select sites, investigators, and study committee members? How to utilize these data? 

** Recruitment monitoring and forecasting: best practices and tools
  + Haoyu Wang: How best to predict enrollment given too slow/too fast
    scenarios are not uncommon at all?
  + Tobias Straubinger: What are the best-suited models for
    recruitment, which parameters improve the model and how can
    historic trial performance be used for future trial performance
    forecasting?
  + Fei Chen: How to mix different sources of information in to the
    forecast, with what weight? Sources of information include:
    actuals, historical projections on sites, expecations of local
    teams, baseline plan
  + Bochao Jia: We may need to differentiate the screening projection, enrollment (randomization projection) and the projection of time for enrollment completion may be       more interested.

** Study design and its impact on operations
  + Haoyu Wang: How to further facilitate/simplify/remove hurdles when
    implementing innovative designs (e.g., inferential seamless) given
    current operational challenges/complexities?
  + Forrest Williamson:

** Operational efficiencies in non-traditional trial settings (e.g., DCTs, PCTs) 
  + Jun Xing: How can we design and implement decentralized,
    pragmatic, and observational trials in a way that optimally
    balances operational feasibility, gap between trail design
    assumptions between efficacy and effectiveness, and struggle to
    maintain high data quality, while aligning with real-world
    clinical practice?
    
** Ensuring representativeness of trial populations and generalizability
  + Bohdana Ratitch: How to dynamically monitor characteristics of
    participants enrolled in a clinical trial with respect to the key
    characteristics of the target population and provide site
    enrollment targets for an ongoing trial to meet population
    representativeness objectives?

** Clinical drug supply optimization
   + Kaifeng Lu: Improving drug supply assumptions and forecasts by
     providing more accurate discontinuation/loss-to-follow
     up/skipping-visit modeling
   + Fei Chen: Overview of 4C and other drug demand forecast software
     and workflows and provide practical guidelines on how to engage
     stakeholders to improve their workflow
   + Fei Chen: simulation based platform for 4C + OMP     
   + Fei Chen: how to demonstrate value of statistics: retroactively
     using existing supply software like 4c counter-factual outcomes
     through simulation
     
** Dynamic Trial Monitoring & Adaptive Operations
  + Palani Ravindran: Which operational metrics and AI/ML techniques
    are most predictive and reliable for emerging risks in ongoing
    clinical trials (e.g., site/patient anomalies, protocol
    deviations)?
  + Zhuoxin Yu: How to better predict and monitor events and dropouts, both at study level and at region/site level?

** Strategic data collection and analysis planning for alignment with Target Product Profile
+ Zhuoxin Yu: What is the best blood sample collection strategy for PK, ADA, biomarkers, to reduce the total amount of blood needed from patients while maintain the quality of data analyses. 

** Regulatory perspectives

  + Fei Chen: recommend more rigorous operational planning into study design
    - 5.6:855 Operational Considerations
      - Use of an adaptive design can add challenges to the operational execution of a clinical trial and these should be addressed at the trial planning stage.
    - Propose to add the following paragraph to section
   
 Adaptations in clinical trials inherently introduce unpredictable
 demands on drug supply, potentially causing delays that adversely
 impact trial timelines. This challenge presents a significant
 opportunity to underscore the crucial role of operational planning in
 adaptive design strategies. An enhanced focus should be placed on
 thoroughly assessing the operational characteristicsâ€”specifically
 examining the impacts of adaptations on drug supply, randomization
 processes, data quality, and considerations for Multi-Regional
 Clinical Trials (MRCT), Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCT) and
 Pragmatic Clinical Trials (PCT). When evaluating the benefits and
 drawbacks of adaptive designs in contrast to traditional approaches,
 these operational aspects are pivotal. Moreover, the introduction of
 a 'design for adaptive operations' should be championed, ensuring
 that operational planning is as rigorously conceived as the
 statistical methods detailed in this guidance document. Doing so will
 help align operational strategies with statistical rigor to optimize
 trial efficiency and mitigate risks associated with supply
 fluctuations and other operational challenges.

** Stakeholder engagement
  + Fei Chen: How to effectively engage and collaborate across different
    operational teams and functions (e.g. clinical supply chain vs
    trial delivery & execution), convince stake holders to embrace
    change and overcome territorial issues
  + Fei Chen: how to demonstrate value through retrospective
    counter-factual analysis based on existing workflow?
